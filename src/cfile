                          newNTL Configuration File
                          ----------------------

This file may be modified prior to building newNTL so as to specify
some basic configuration options, and to customize
how code is generated so as to improve performance.

The Basic Configuration Options must be set by hand.  If you use the
configuration wizard, then these flags should be set before
the installation process begins;  there values will be retained
by the wizard.

The Performance Options can be set either by hand, by editing this 
file, or (on most Unix platforms) can be set automatically using
the configuration wizard which runs when newNTL is installed.

All newNTL header files include this file.
By setting these flags here, instead of on the compiler command line,
it is easier to guarantee that newNTL library and client code use
consistent settings.  


                                How to do it
                                ------------

To set a flag, just replace the pre-processor directive 
'if 0' by 'if 1' for that flag, which causes the appropriate macro 
to be defined.  Of course,  to unset a flag, just replace the 
'if 1' by an 'if 0'.

You can also do this more conveniently via the command line
using the configure script.
